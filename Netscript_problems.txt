Issue: I am getting a 'Invalid Module: "./NetscriptDefinitions"'
  when running .ts files natively in bit burner, when they are 
  synced from external vscode editor. I have to import { NS } 
  externally for the types, but including it in .ts scripts inside
  bitburner is apparently no go?

Using .ts files directly in bitburner terminal

  > run test.ts 

  test.ts:
  async function main( ns:NS ) { // do nothing }

  This works just fine. 

However! Using an external editor, if i want autocompletion 
and the NS type recognized, i have to 

  import { NS } from "./NetscriptDefinitions"

The file then syncs to bitburner, with the import statement,
but throws the Issue above. Invalid Module: "./NetscriptDefinitons"

NetscriptDefinitions.d.ts exists in bitburner, it's properly 
placed etc. 

Is there some way around this, or am I going to have to go back to 
transpiling the .ts to .js and ignoring the fact that .ts files "work"
natively in bitburner now? Cause that's disappointing.

Am I missing something?
