Implemented new hackable server. Problems include memory bloat, too many functions on >100 thread scripts (auto / hackableserver.ts)

Need to split weaken and hack/grow into two separate scripts, so that we divide up some of the memory bloat, and also
allow weaken to be more intelligent. Right now its downright stupid.

right now seems to be focusing on mirroring /dist.

need to get that pointed at a src, and no longer transpile or compile
the ts to js, since bitburner can natively do ts now.
